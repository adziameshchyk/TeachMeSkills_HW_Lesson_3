# Arrays

>This repository was created for homework in lesson â„–3.

## Tasks:

0. Create an array of integers.  
   Write a program that displays a message about whether a given number is in an array or not.  
   Let the search number be specified from the console.
1. Create an array of integers. Remove all occurrences of the given number from the array.  
   Let the number be specified from the console (Scanner class).  
   If there is no such number, print messages about it.  
   The result should be a new array without the specified number.
2. Create and fill an array with random numbers and output the maximum, minimum, and average.  
   To generate a random number, use the Math.random() method.  
   Let it be possible to create an array of arbitrary size.  
   Let the size of the array be entered from the console.
3. Create 2 arrays of 5 numbers.
   Print the arrays to the console on two separate lines.  
   Calculate the average of the elements of each array and report which of the arrays this  
   value turned out to be greater (or report that their arithmetic averages are equal).
4. If the user has entered an invalid number, the program should ask the user to repeat the input.  
   Create an array of n random integers and print it to the screen.  
   Let the array size be set from the console and the array size can be greater than 5 and less than or equal to 10.  
   If n does not satisfy the condition, print a message about it.  
   Create a second array with only the even elements of the first array, if any, and display it on the screen.
5. Create an array and populate the array.  
   Print the array to the screen as a string.  
   Replace every odd-indexed element with zero.  
   Again, print the array to the screen on a separate line.
6. Create an array of strings.  
   Fill it in with arbitrary people's names.  
   Sort the array.  
   Output the result to the console.
7. Implement a bubble sort algorithm.
